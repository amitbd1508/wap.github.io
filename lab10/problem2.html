        1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
 
 setImmediate is called during the test processing phase of the event loop, while setTimeout is called 
 after the given delay and also blocks I/O. We use setImmediate  because it allows scheduling calls return 
 in the I/O cycle, ensuring that our callback runs first regardless of any other timers and their 
 delay. Also, setImmediate will not block the event loop, because the recursive event  call is  only made on  the next 
 iteration of the event loop.


 2.Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?

 The event loop has many stages. Process.nextTick is called at the start of each event loop and 
 between each event phase. While, 
 setImmediate is called during the test processing phase of the event loop. 
 Actually, process.nextTick has higher priority than setImmediate.


 3.Does Node.js has window object?

 Although node.js is built on  javascript (v8 engine), it does not have a window object. 
 The Window object is a global object in the browser. On the other hand, Node runs on the server and therefore has no window like its 
 global objects
